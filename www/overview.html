<h1>Overview - What is this side for?</h1>

<P> This side will give you an introduction on how to use the mlr-package. <br> <br>
Our focus is on your comprehension of the basic functions and applications. <br> 
For technical refinement and special cases you can have a look at the <a href="rdocs/00Index.html">  R Documentation </a>  </P>

<P> The approach is step by step and orients itself on the proceeding of a basic data set analysis: </P>
<ul>
<li> What is the data set like?
<li> What are the input und output variables?
<li> What is the target of the analysis?
<li> Which learner do I want to get a model?
<li> Which parameter and hyperparameter are reasonable? How do I get them?
<li> How can I evaluate my model?
<li> Do I want to get predicitions for new data?
<li> Which of my different models is best? And why?
<li> Which model is on which of my datasets the best?
</ul>
<P>We always show classification- and regression-examples as representation for the two big fields of data analysis. </P>

<P> The idea is to understand the main functionality of the package functions and inspecially to know about the possibilities to customize the functions to your own application. Because this is the power of mlr :-). </P>

<P> Enjoy reading! </P>
