<h1>Overview</h1>

<P> This web page page will provide you with an in-depth introduction on how to use the mlr package for machine learning experiments
and optimization in R. <br> <br>
Our focus is on your comprehension of the basic functions and applications. <br> 
For technical stuff and special cases you should take a look at the <a href="rdocs/00Index.html">R Documentation</a>.</P>

<P> The approach is step by step and orients itself on the proceeding of a basic data set analysis: </P>
<ul>
<li> What is your data and the aim of your analysis?
<li> How do you select learning algorithms and set them up?
<li> What about hyperparameters?
<li> How to predict new data?
<li> How to evaluate my model and its predictions?
</ul>
<P>We present various simple examples from classification and regression during this tutorial to illustrate the main features of 
the package.</P>

<P> Enjoy reading! </P>
