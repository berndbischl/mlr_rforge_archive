<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Container for the results of a benchmark experiment.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>bench.result-class</code>: Getter. <br>
</p>
<p>The &quot;perf&quot; getter is probably the most common one, it returns a list of 3 dim. arrays of performance values for every data set.
The dimension are: learners, resampling iterations and measures.
You can reduce the list or the contained array by using the optional arguments &quot;task&quot;, &quot;learner&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;, &quot;iter&quot; and &quot;aggr&quot;. 
&quot;task&quot; and &quot;learners&quot; must be set to a char vector of IDs repectively, &quot;measure&quot; to names of recorded performance measures in the experiment,
&quot;iter&quot; to an integer vector of selected resampling interations. The default for these is to select everything. 
&quot;aggr&quot; can be used to aggregate the results accross the resampling interations (see <code>aggregations</code>). 
The default is not to do any aggregation. You can also set &quot;aggr&quot; to &quot;resampling&quot; which does the default aggregation 
of the used resampling stratgegy.    
'drop' is by default TRUE, which means that the structures are simplified as much as possible, if you don't want this set 'drop' to FALSE. 
</p>
<p>The following getters all return list of lists of objects: prediction, conf.mat
The first list iterates the tasks, the second one the learners, both are named by respective IDs.
You can reduce these lists by using the optional arguments 'task' and 'learner'. 
'drop' is by default TRUE, which means that the list structures are simplified as much as possible, if you don't want this set 'drop' to FALSE. 
</p>
<p>The following getters all return list of lists of lists: opt.result, opt.par, opt.perf, opt.path, tuned.par, sel.var
The first list iterates the tasks, the second one the learners, both are named by respective IDs, the third list iterates the
resampling iterations. You can reduce these lists by using the optional arguments 'task' and 'learner'. 
'drop' is by default TRUE, which means that the list structures are simplified as much as possible, if you don't want this set 'drop' to FALSE.
