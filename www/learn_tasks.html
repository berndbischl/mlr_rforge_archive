<h1>Learning task</h1>

<p>Learning tasks are the basic element of the package to encapsulate the data set and all relevant information 
regarding the purpose of the task. This will be at least the target variable, but might also be information about 
excluded (ID) variables, misclassification costs or case weights.</p>

<p>Currently two subclasses of a <a href="rdocs/LearnTask-class.html">LearnTask</a> exist, <a href="rdocs/ClassifTask-class.html">ClassifTask</a> 
for classification problems and <a href="rdocs/RegrTask-class.html">RegrTask</a> for regression.
A classification task is created by using the <a href="rdocs/makeClassifTask.html">makeClassifTask</a> factory method.
The target variable is converted to a factor if it is a logical, integer or character vector.
Accordingly use <a href="rdocs/makeRegrTask.html">makeRegrTask</a> for defining a regression task.

<h3>Classification example</h3>

<p>In the following example we define a classification task for the data set BreastCancer 
(from the package mlbench) and exclude the ID variable from all further model fitting and evaluation.</p>

<pre>
	library(mlbench); data(BreastCancer)
	ct <- makeClassifTask(data = BreastCancer, target = "Class", exclude = "Id")
</pre>

<p> The now defined classification task also gives you some convenience methods to access properties of the data set:</p>

<pre>
	<com># before we start, let's examine ct</com>
	<com># print useful info about the data set</com>
	ct
	<res>
	Classification problem BreastCancer
	Features:
	double    int   fact   char    log 
	     0      0      9      0      0 
	Observations: 699
	Missings: TRUE
	in 16 observations and 1 features
	Infinites: FALSE
	Target: Class
	Classes: 2
   	benign malignant 
   	   458       241 
	Positive class: benign 
	Has weights: FALSE
	Has blocking: FALSE
	Has costs: FALSE	
	</res>	
	
	<com># as this is a binary problem, we see that a positive class is selected by default</com>
	<com># this will generally be the first class in the factor levels of the target</com>
	<com># you probably want to select this manually for your applications</com>
	ct <- makeClassifTask(data = BreastCancer, target = "Class", exclude = "Id", positive = "benign")
	
	<com># access more information </com>
	<com># get the name of the target variable by accessing the corresponding slot of ct - same for regression</com>
	ct@desc@target
	
	<com># get the names of the input variables - same for regression</com>
	getFeatureNames(ct)

	<com># get target values for all observations  - same for regression </com>
	targets(ct)

	<com># get the class labels</com>		 
	classLevels(ct)
</pre>


<p> Look at the documentation of the relevant class, if you are interested in what kind of "getter"-functions 
are available, e.g. for the <a href="rdocs/LearnTask-class.html">task</a>.

<p> We can include further information like costs or weights optionally:

<pre>
	<com># non-default costs for wrong predictions:</com>
	costs <- matrix (c(0, 1, 2, 0), 2, 2)
	colnames(costs) <- rownames(costs) <- classLevels(ct)
	costs
	<res>
	          benign malignant
	benign         0         2
	malignant      1         0
	</res>

	ct <- makeClassifTask(data = BreastCancer, target = "Class", exclude = "Id", costs = costs)
	
	<com># (nonsensical) observation weights</com>
	ct <- makeClassifTask(data = BreastCancer, target = "Class", exclude = "Id", weights = 1:699)
</pre>


<p>From this classification task we can now train various models, which will be covered in the 
section <a href="train.html">Training </a>. 
Before that, let's look at a regression experiment:</p>


<h3>Regression example</h3>
<pre>
	<com># we will generally take the BostonHousing data set as regression example</com>
	library(mlbench); data(BostonHousing)
	rt <- makeRegrTask(data = BostonHousing, target = "medv")
	rt
	<res>
	Regression problem BostonHousing
	Features:
	double    int   fact   char    log 
	    12      0      1      0      0 
	Observations: 506
	Missings: FALSE
	Infinites: FALSE
	Target: medv
	Has weights: FALSE
	Has blocking: FALSE
	</res>	
	
	<com># rest works analogous to classification task</com>
	<com># access more information </com>
	<com># get target name and the names of the input variables</com>
	rt@desc@target
	getFeatureNames(rt)

	<com># get target values for all observations</com>
	targets(rt)
</pre>
</body>
