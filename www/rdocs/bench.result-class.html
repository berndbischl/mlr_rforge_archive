<h2>bench-result</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Container for the results of a benchmark experiment.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>bench.result-class</code>: Getter. <br>
The following getters all return list of lists of objects: perf, prediction, opt.result.
The first list iterates the tasks, the second one the learnes, both are named by respective ids.
You can reduce these list by using the optional arguments 'task' and 'learner'. 'Drop' is by default TRUE, which means that 
the list structures are simplified as much as possible, if you don't want this set 'drop' to FALSE.
