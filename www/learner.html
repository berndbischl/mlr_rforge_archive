<h1>Wrapped learners</h1>

<p>These classes provide a unified interface to all classification/regression methods in R. 
Some are already integrated, others are not, but the package is specifically designed to make extensions simple. 
If one of your favorite methods is missing, either send me an email or see the part of the tutorial how to 
extend the package yourself.</p>

<P>You have two options to access the learning algorithms in mlr. 
Either by passing the name as a string to the appropriate method or by constructing the wrapped.learner object 
explicitly:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Let's take a look at the iris example to show the two different possibilities: </p>
<pre>
	<com># Classification task: </com>
	ct <- make.task(data = iris, target = "Species")

	<com># First possibility: </com>
	<com>#   passing the name as a character string to the appropriate method: </com>
	model <- train("classif.lda", ct)

	<com># Second possibility: </com>
	<com>#   constructing the wrapped learner object explicitly </com>
	<com>#   this way we can also set hyperparameters </com>
	wl <- make.learner("classif.rpart", minsplit = 4)
	model <- train(wl, ct)

	<com>#   Let's see what wl is: </com>
	wl
	
	<res>  
	Classification learner RPart from package rpart
	
	Supports multiclass: TRUE
	Supported features Nums:TRUE Factors:TRUE Chars:FALSE
	Supports missings: TRUE
	Supports probabilities: TRUE
	Supports decision values: FALSE
	Supports weights: TRUE
	Supports costs: TRUE
	
	Hyperparameters: minsplit=4
	</res>
</pre>

<P> As you can see above, the wrapped learner includes a lot of information about the properties of 
the learning algorithm. 
This helps you to decide whether a selected algorithm is appropriate for your data or not 
(this will be checked internally as well).
</P> 

<P>Every method in mlr, which has a learning algorithm as an argument, will allow both variants. 
The latter one allows a bit more flexibility when you want to change default parameters or add something more 
complex on top of the learning algorithm (e.g. see <a href="tuning.html">Tuning</a>).</P>

<P>To see which learners are already implemented type <a href="rdocs/learners.html">?learners</a> 
in your R console.</P>
